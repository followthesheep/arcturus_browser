Abstract:
  A spectral atlas of the infrared spectrum of the bright K 2 giant
  Arcturus has been completed using the 4 meter Mayall telescope and
  FTS. The 0.9-5.3 um spectrum of Arcturus was observed at high
  signal-to-noise with a resolution of 100,000.  Telluric lines were
  removed by using telluric transmission spectra generated from
  McMath-Pierce solar spectra or 4 meter lunar spectra.  The spectrum of
  Arcturus was observed on two different dates selected to give large
  opposite heliocentric shifts.  The spectra observed on the different
  dates have been independently corrected for telluric absorption with
  the result that the telluric spectrum has been effectively removed
  from all but the most obscured wavelengths of the Arcturus spectrum.
  We attempted to identify lines with central depths stronger than a few
  percent.  Identifications seem well in hand with the unidentified
  lines apparently atomic in origin.  The atlas is available either on
  an AAS CD-ROM or as an ASP monograph.


Description:
  The atlas is contained in 310 spectral files and two line
  indentification files plus a file containing a list of the files and
  unobserved spectral regions.  The spectral file names are in the form
  'abnnnnn' where 'nnnnn' denotes the spectral region, e.g. file 'ab4300'
  contains spectra for the 4300-4325 cm-1 range.  The atomic and
  molecular line identifications are in files 'appendix.a' and
  'appendix.b'.  The file 'appendix.c' is a book-keeping device used to
  correlate the plot plages and spectral files with frequency.  See the
  author-supplied description in 'readme.dat' for more information.
