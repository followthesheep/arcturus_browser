The electronic version of the Infrared Atlas consists of 310 ASCII spectral 
files and two line identification files plus a file containing a list of the 
files and unobserved spectral regions.  Each spectral file contains the spectra 
used to construct one page of the atlas plots.  The spectrum may be readily 
plotted from these files using standard graphics packages, e.g. MONGO.  The 
hard copy atlas pages were prepared using MONGO.  Below we give a sample MONGO 
program for producing a simplified atlas page.  

The spectral files are labeled abnnnn, where nnnn is the wavenumber of the 
beginning of the page.  For example file ab4300 contains spectra for the 
4300-4325 cm-1 page.  The file structure is as follows:
column 1 contains the frequency scale in wavenumbers
columns 2, 3, and 4 apply to the Arcturus spectrum as observed in summer-
column 2 is the observed Arcturus spectrum
column 3 is the telluric spectrum
column 4 is the ratioed Arcturus spectrum after smoothing and continuum 
     adjustment.  Note that the numbers in this column result from mathematics
     and need not convey physical information.  Numbers are present in the 
     ratio for spectral regions where all information has been blocked by 
     opaque telluric lines.  These regions are not plotted in the hard copy 
     version.
Columns 5, 6, and 7 contain the winter spectra corresponding to
     columns 2, 3, and 4.

The atomic and molecular line identifications are listed separately in the
files appendixA and appendixB which contain the same information as
appendices A and B of the hard copy version of the atlas.  The file
appendixC is a book-keeping device used to correlate the plot pages and
ASCII files with frequency.

The hard copy version of this atlas is available as an ASP monograph.

! MONGO instructions for producing a simplified atlas page.
! Sample spectral plot is for a nominal 25 cm-1 page at 4475-4500 cm-1
! (the plot actual covers 4473 to 4502 cm-1).
! Change the output device, input file name, plot limits and Doppler 
! correction as needed.  Then run as an INPUT file in MONGO.
