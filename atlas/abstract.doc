     ABSTRACT.  A spectral atlas of the infrared spectrum of the bright K 2
     giant Arcturus has been completed using the 4 meter Mayall telescope
     and FTS. The 0.9-5.3 um spectrum of Arcturus was observed at high
     signal-to-noise with a resolution of 100,000.  Telluric lines were
     removed by using telluric transmission spectra generated from
     McMath-Pierce solar spectra or 4 meter lunar spectra.  The spectrum of
     Arcturus was observed on two different dates selected to give large
     opposite heliocentric shifts.  The spectra observed on the different
     dates have been independently corrected for telluric absorption with
     the result that the telluric spectrum has been effectively removed
     from all but the most obscured wavelengths of the Arcturus spectrum.
     We attempted to identify lines with central depths stronger than a few
     percent.  Identifications seem well in hand with the unidentified
     lines apparently atomic in origin.  The atlas is available either on
     an AAS CD-ROM or as an ASP monograph.
